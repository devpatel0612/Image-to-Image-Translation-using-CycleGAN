CycleGAN is a model that aims to solve the image-to-image translation problem. The goal of the image-to-image translation problem is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. However, obtaining paired examples isn't always feasible. CycleGAN tries to learn this mapping without requiring paired input-output images, using cycle-consistent adversarial networks.
